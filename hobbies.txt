My hobbies are Colorado basic: hiking, biking, camping, skiing. I also enjoy capoeira, the Brazilian martial art also known as Brazilian break dance fighting. I enjoy attending live performances, whether concerts, plays, musicals, or sports. My nickname is Eric-a-pedia because of my prowess in useless trivia.
