We recently spent Christmas in Hawaii with my family. One morning, MaryKate and I woke up early for a sunrise yoga class on the beach. Toward the end of the class, while everyone else was meditating with eyes closed, I looked out over the lagoon and saw a whale breaching. I poked MaryKate and told her to look out, just as the whale breached again. A minute or two later, the clouds parted and a double rainbow appeared, landing right in the lagoon in front of us.
